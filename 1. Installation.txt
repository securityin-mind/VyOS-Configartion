 Introduction
Router distribution VYOS its an open source popular linux distribution build on top of debian
Its comparable to any cisco router or juniper router
It can be installed in a virtual environment 
It can be installed in most hardware or old servers or laptop
It can replace any router that you buy of the shelf 
It can be used in your small medium sized business to do all your routing functions
It runs all the popular routing protocal OSPF v2, BGB, Stateful firewall build into it,DHCP relay, VPN all kinds of tunnelling technologies
Its turly power packed and worth the look
Its formally vyatta but brocade bought them out and stopped on the development community edition but most of the configuration stayed the same.
